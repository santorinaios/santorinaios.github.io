Welcome! I am a 1st year PhD student in the <a href= "https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/cs">Department of Informatics</a> at <a href= https://www.aueb.gr/en>AUEB</a>,<br> where I am a member of the <a href= http://pages.cs.aueb.gr/othersites/TheoryGroup/index.html>CS Theory group</a>. I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://pages.cs.aueb.gr/~markakis/">Vangelis Markakis</a>.

<!--My research is focused on problems at the intersection of Machine Learning, Game Theory and Optimization. I am also interested in Discrete Fair Division.-->

Starting July 2023, my research is supported by an Archimedes AI PhD fellowship.

I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href= "https://www.ntua.gr/en/">NTUA</a>, where I was a a member of <a href="https://corelab.ntua.gr/index.html">CoReLab</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/">Dimitris Fotakis</a>.
